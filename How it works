How the Software Works

1. Preprocessing
The preprocess method:

1.Tokenizes the text into sentences and words.
2.Converts words to lowercase.
3.Removes stopwords and non-alphanumeric tokens.
4.Lemmatizes words to their base forms.

This ensures clean and consistent text for summarization and topic modeling.

2. Summarization
The extractive_summarization method:

1.Uses TF-IDF Vectorizer to calculate term importance.
2.Applies Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to reduce dimensionality and identify the most significant sentences.
Selects the top num_sentences based on LSA scores to generate the summary.

3. Topic Modeling
The topic_modeling method:

1.Uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify num_topics from the tokenized documents.
2.Converts the processed documents into a bag-of-words representation.
3.Outputs the most significant topics.

4. Integration
The integrate_components method:

1.Combines the summary and topic modeling.
2.Aligns the summary with the topics by mapping the summary's words to topics.

5. Evaluation
The evaluate method:

1.Uses the ROUGE scorer to compare the generated summary with the reference summary.
2.Outputs precision, recall, and F1 scores for ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L.
