How to Use

1. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed. Install the required Python libraries using:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn gensim nltk rouge-score

2. Download Required NLTK Resources
The software uses NLTK for tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization. Download the necessary resources before running the program:

import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')

3. Input Preparation
Prepare the following inputs:

Documents: A list of strings where each string is a document.
Reference Summary: A concise string summarizing the input documents, used for evaluation.

Example:
documents = [
    "Document 1 text here.",
    "Document 2 text here.",
    "Document 3 text here."
]

reference_summary = "A concise summary of the documents."

4. Run the Software
Run the main Python script (project.py). 

It Will:

1. Preprocesses the documents.
2. Generates an extractive summary.
3. Performs topic modeling.
4. Aligns the summary with the identified topics.
5. Evaluates the summary using ROUGE metrics.

Output:

1. The generated summary.
2. The identified topics.
3. Topic alignment with the summary.
4. ROUGE evaluation scores.
